# Every migration must have a source plugin, which controls the delivery of our
# source data. In this case, our source plugin has the name "usaid_migrate_regions",
# which Drupal resolves to the PHP class defined in
# src/Plugin/migrate/source/UsAidMigrateRegions.php.

# Every migration must also have a destination plugin, which handles writing
# the migrated data in the appropriate form for that particular kind of data.
# Most Drupal content is an "entity" of one type or another, and we need to
# specify what entity type we are populating (in this case, taxonomy terms).
# Unlike the source plugin (which is specific to our particular scenario), this
# destination plugin is implemented in Drupal itself.

  plugin: entity:taxonomy_term
# Here's the meat of the migration - the processing pipeline. This describes how
# each destination field is to be populated based on the source data. For each
# destination field, one or more process plugins may be invoked.
