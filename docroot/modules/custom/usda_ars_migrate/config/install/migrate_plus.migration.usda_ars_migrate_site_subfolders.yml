# A "migration" is, in technical terms, a plugin whose configuration describes
# how to read source data, process it (generally by mapping source fields to
# destination fields), and write it to Drupal.

# The machine name for a migration, used to uniquely identify it.
id: usda_ars_migrate_site_subfolders

# A human-friendly description of the migration.
label: 9 - USDA ARS Sites/Locations SubFolders

# The machine name of the group containing this migration (which contains shared
# configuration to be merged with our own configuration here).

# Every migration must have a source plugin, which controls the delivery of our
# source data. In this case, our source plugin has the name "usaid_migrate_regions",
# which Drupal resolves to the PHP class defined in
# src/Plugin/migrate/source/UsAidMigrateRegions.php.
